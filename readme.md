# Frontend practice with header

## Main goal:
Create HTML page with header. Understand `flexbox` usage. Create
HTML layout from the mockup.

Use this [mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/KAV1NnDp7hgQtPnaD6XdOcnG/Moyo-Header?node-id=0%3A1) 
for development.

If you don't want to see other users cursors you can disable `Multiplayer 
Cursors` in figma. [Learn how](https://mate-academy.github.io/layout_task-guideline/figma.html#multiplayer-cursors)

## Common mistakes
* Do not use tabs. Use 2 spaces for indentation.
* Don't use repeated styles.
* Don't use extra elements for blue line. Figure out how to work with `::after`
* Check font styles. Use [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

## Requirements:

* pay attention the mock is adaptive. Develop the layout to fit on 1024px and
1200px the same as on the mock.
* reset browser's default margins
* use images from [src/images](src/images)
* Use semantic tags. `<header>`, `<nav>`
* change links styles on :hover
* follow styles from the mock
* link with blue color and line below is an active link. It should have
 `class="is-active"` and relevant styles
* link with only blue color is an example of `:hover` styles. Every link in the 
row should have blue color on :hover. 
* add attribute `data-qa="hover"` to the 4th link for testing (`Ноутбуки и 
компьютеры`)
