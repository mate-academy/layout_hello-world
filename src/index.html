    <h1 class="title">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</h1>
    <h2 class="subtitle">Preamble</h2>
    <p>
      Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable
      rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice
      and peace in the world,
      <br>
      Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous
      acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world
      in which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom
      from fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common
      people,
      <br>
      Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last
      resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be
      protected by the rule of law,
      <br>
        Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between
        nations,
      <br>
        Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their
        faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person
        and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote
        social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,
      <br>
          Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in cooperation
          with the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of
          human rights and fundamental freedoms,
      <br>
          Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the
          greatest importance for the full realization of this pledge,
      <br>
          Now, therefore,
      <br>
          The General Assembly,
      <br>
          Proclaims this Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of
          achievement for all peoples and all nations, to the end that every individual and
          every organ of society, keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by
          teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by
          progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and
          effective recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States
          themselves and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.
    </p>
