      This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the page is about a movie, this is the time when you might give a few details about it, such as saying that the movie was released in 2002, won multiple awards, and that it stars actors such as Will Smith. Why is all this information here? It isn't for any real reason. It's just filler text. It isn't meant to be read. Seriously, you should just stop reading this. Why are you still reading? You aren't getting any information by reading this. What's the point? Stop reading. Go away.

    <h2>Sub-heading</h2>
    <p>
      If your page is about a movie, this is where you might put information about the director, producer, and the list of actors. Why? Because that's all very important information, and it gives the reader a better idea of how awesome the movie is. If this page is about a book, this is where you might give information about the author, publisher, and how many pages the book has. If this page is about a band, this is where you might tell your readers how to find the band's music online, what genre the band plays, and where the band comes from. If this page is about a city, this is where you might tell your readers how to find the city, what the population is, and what the weather is like. If the page is about a recipe, this is where you might tell your readers how long it takes to make the recipe, where they can find the ingredients, and so on.
